# Everything you want to know about Real-Time Payments
As someone involved in the world of finance and technology, it’s almost inevitable that you’ve heard about Real-Time Payments. But are you wondering-- what’s the big deal? At this point, most everyone in the FinTech world would expect that it’s common knowledge. But if you still have questions and don’t want to feel left out of hype, this is your guide to navigating Real-Time Payments; where it came from, where it’s taking the world, and what it means for you and your business.

#### **First, the basics.**

The Clearing House is this big conglomeration of the largest commercial banks within the banking industry. The group formed back in 1853 to foster industry collaboration and has withstood every financial crisis or world disasters since without interruption. TCH has been at the forefront of every major banking innovation--in operations, technology development, thought leadership, policy-making, consulting, research--you name it! Impressive, right?

So, in total alignment with their historic brand, TCH launched RTP® in 2017, the first real-time payment system that is accessible to all banks in the United States. The RTP® network is remarkable and is finally bringing banking up to speed with the rest of the real-time world. Any financial institution can onboard the RTP® network and give their customers the option of instantly transferring money for large sum transactions. Think Venmo, but for business or government transactions--moving thousands, or even millions of dollars at a time.

According to TCH’s frequently asked questions page, here are all the benefits of using the RTP® network:

1. 24/7 – The RTP network is live and operates 24/7, which allows financial institutions to send or receive payments at any time.
2. Immediate Availability – Recipients receive the payment within seconds of the sending bank initiating the transaction; RTP network receiving financial institutions are required to make funds available immediately, except where necessary for risk management or legal compliance purposes.
3. Payment Certainty – Sending financial institutions (FI) are not able to revoke or recall a payment once it has been authorized and submitted to the RTP network. However, there is a process to facilitate FI-to-FI communication around return of funds sent in error.
4. Ubiquity – All federally insured depository institutions can be RTP network participants, regardless of size.
5. Extensibility – Rich, flexible messaging functionality is included to support value-added products. For example, the RTP network provides messaging that enables a request for payment of a bill or invoice.
6. Convenience – Customers of RTP network financial institution participants are able to initiate payments from their existing accounts.
7. Cash Flow Control – The ability to send and receive immediate payments gives customers more control over cash flow, which may be particularly important for cash-constrained small businesses and consumers.
8. Adaptability – The RTP network has a flexible architecture to adapt to changing market needs.

#### **What does that mean for you?**

There are so many stories about online service companies that provide outstanding service to their customers, only to find out that the payment was later cancelled. Don’t let this be you. Real-Time Payments was created to mitigate these kinds of circumstances. If you’re a small business, you can ask your financial institution to get onboard the RTP® network. Ask them to protect you by joining the Real-Time revolution.

If you’re a small bank, credit union, or other type of financial institution, it’s time to get onboard! The RTP® network is the future of large sum transactions and in order to stay relevant, your organization needs to get involved with Real-Time Payments.

#### **Unfortunately, people aren’t getting onboard as fast as TCH thought.**

An article on smartpayments.com tells us that a survey from the Association of Financial Professionals says 54% of financial institutions that responded to the survey feel unprepared for the widespread adoption of Real-Time Payments.
